# HW-4--Code-Quiz

Your Task
I was tasked with completing a coding assessment that includes multiple choice questions in order to familiarize myuself with the skills covered in this unit. 

The quiz had to be a timed coding quiz, with multiple choice questions. It was required to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javasript.

The acceptance criteria was as follows:

- the quiz stores high scores
- the user can gauge their progress compared to their peers
- the time and first question displays when the user presses start
- the user receives a penalty when they get the question wrong
- the quiz is over when the user's time runs out
- the user can save their initials and their score
